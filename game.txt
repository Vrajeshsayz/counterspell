Game Ideas:
    - Shadow Duel:
            - Players select their own strengths
            - The opponents strong points are your weaknesses
            - Your pros outweigh your cons
            - Quote on homescreen: "Everyone has their weaknesses, it depends how you overcome them"
            - Keymaps:
                    - W jump
                    - D move right
                    - A move left
                    - S crouch
                    - P punch
                    - K kick
                    - Space power move
            - If someone crouches, and the opponent punches,

            - 3 character options
                - power punch - 2x damage
                - power kick - 2x damage
                - high speed - teleporation + super punch
            - under each character, there is a pros cons table
            - if punch is missed, the person freezes
